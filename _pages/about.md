Graphene Security was founded in 2020 as a consultancy focused on cyber security solutions that are strong and light. Our design philosophy emerged from extensive experience working with complexity. From solving difficult cyber security problems for some of Australia's largest organisations, to the practical realities of working to attack and defend them, we saw the great value of simplicity, visibility, and mitigation design focused on real-world threats.

From 2024, we have evolved into a design and implementation company focused on putting these principles into practice. Our multidisciplinary capability has 'been there, done that' in consulting, assessing threat, responding to incidents, simulating advanced attackers, and building solutions for a huge range of organisations. We know what cyber security looks like in the real world, and we know many organisations are having a harder time with it than outsiders would think.

We are here to help, and we see the most potential in acting as a specialised 'force multiplier' to compliment existing capabilities and providers. By using our knowledge and experience, alongside best-in-class tools and technologies, our focus is on creating environments that are a nightmare for attackers, while making life easier for users and defenders.

If this all sounds interesting, we'd love to hear from you.
