We are a Melbourne-based cyber security design and consulting company. We work with our clients to create tailored, effective and pragmatic solutions that allow them to navigate a complex world with confidence and clarity.

Our approach is based on the principle that security should be strong and light; strong enough to manage risk within acceptable limits, while placing no more demand on people and resources than necessary. We emphasise targeted, threat-based mitigations over sweeping framework-based approaches, and we are driven by a genuine desire to improve our clients' security.

We are also committed to operating an ethical business. This extends to how we work, how we deliver, and who we choose to work with.

Our identity is shaped by our Mission, Personality, Promise and Values (with credit to [Atlassian](https://atlassian.design/brand) for the categories):
