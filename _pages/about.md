### Security, thoughtfully designed for the real world.

Founded in 2020, we are a small and specialised company built to solve problems with greater agility, creativity, and value for money, than the large consultancies we came from. While consulting services remain a strong capability, our primary focus is helping clients take the next step and fix problems directly. Whether working alongside an in-house team, partnered with another third party, or operating independently, we take a proactive yet pragmatic approach to getting things done.

Based in Melbourne, Australia, and typically operating remotely, we work primarily with mid-sized companies with complex technology environments (particularly those including on-premises networks) that can derive the most benefit from our services and capabilities. Manufacturing and financial services companies are focus areas, and we also have strong experience in the aviation and maritime sectors, in addition to other critical infrastructure environments.

In addition to more commonly-known providers such as Microsoft, we partner with a small number of innovative but proven tech companies. These include:

- [Thinkst](https://canary.tools), industry leaders and creators of Canary, a simple, reliable, and highly effective means of detecting intrusions and unauthorised activity - including insider threats
- [Knocknoc](https://knocknoc.io), an excellent Australian startup with a clever yet robust solution to securing remote access and other challenging network connections
- [Airlock Digital](https://www.airlockdigital.com), a proven solution for locking down servers and workstations quickly and effectively, while also supporting high-maturity tech environments
- [Netwrix](https://www.netwrix.com), who acquired a range of useful tools, particularly for managing unstructured data and for quickly identifying issues with complex Active Directory environments

Tools like these, alongside our experience and creativity, form the basis of how we mitigate risks quickly and effectively.
