We are a Melbourne-based company founded with the objective of bringing tier-one cyber security consulting capabilities to organisations that make the world a better place.

Our company is based on the principle that the most effective security is strong and light. From this website to the systems that support our business, Graphene Security is built to be as robust and simple as possible.
