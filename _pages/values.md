We are proud to be an ethical, impact-driven cyber security consultancy with a focus on working with clients who make the world a better place.

What does this mean?


## Our delivery

**We believe in empowering clients and we value simple, effective and durable security improvements over more profit-focused consulting approaches.**

Our focus is on helping our clients, not milking them for revenue or selling them products as a quick fix. While there is a place for ongoing consulting work, and for effective security products, we firmly believe in understanding our clients and providing solutions based on their best interests.

## Our operations

**We care about our people, we minimise our environmental impact and we chose our suppliers and partners based on their ethical profile in addition to the quality of their product or service.**

Our business is built from its foundations to be as ethical as possible. While we are too new to become a certified [B Corporation](https://www.bcorporation.com.au/), we proudly support their Declaration of Interdependence and believe:
- That we must be the change we seek in the world.
- That all business ought to be conducted as if people and place mattered.
- That, through their products, practices, and profits, businesses should aspite to do no harm and benefit all.
- To do so requires that we act with the understanding that we are each dependent upon another and thus responsible for each other and future generations.

**We implement our own advice and make the extra effort to secure our own systems using best practice wherever possible.**

We are passionate about security, and take as much care with our own security arrangements (if not more) as we would advise our clients to take.

## Our clients

**We actively seek to work with clients that provide social and environmental benefit, and will decline to engage with organisations engaged in practices that are contrary to our values.**
