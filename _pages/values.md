We are proud to be an ethical, impact-driven cyber security consultancy with a focus on working with clients who make the world a better place.

What does this mean?

## Our clients

**We will not accept work from clients engaged in practices that are contrary to our values, and will actively seek to work with clients that provide social and environmental benefit.**

## Our delivery

**We believe in empowering clients and we value simple, effective and durable security improvements over more profit-focused consulting approaches.**

## Our operations

**We care about people, we minimise our environmental impact and we chose our suppliers and partners based on their ethical profile in addition to the quality of their product or service.**

**We implement our own advice and make the extra effort to secure our own systems using best practice wherever possible.**
