# Attackers don't fight fair. Why should you?

Cyber security can seem like the sort of thing where it just takes a single mistake for everything to go wrong.

That can be true. However, in the majority of cases, the organisation hasn't lost as soon as an attacker gains initial access; the impact is only realised once the attacker achieves their objectives, such as stealing your data and deploying ransomware.

In the time between those two points, you are in competition with the attacker: You win if you can discover them and remove their access - or if they decide to give up. They win if they are allowed to continue until it's too late.

Our specialty is helping organisations of all sizes maximise their home ground advantage using our deep experience, best-in-class tools, and every dirty trick we can think of. Wherever you are in your cyber security maturity, whatever industry you're in, we want to give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your IT environment is no ordinary target.
