Identify and close the gaps between cyber and physical security.

Organisations are increasingly realising the importance of understanding and managing the complex interplay between cyber and physical security. Though cyber-physical convergence is an emerging area of cyber security, we are unique in having a deep knowledge in both areas.

Ultimately, there are fundamental similarities between both physical and cyber security - but the real challenges lie in the detail. We happen to be hugely interested in the detail of both areas, and have the background and experience to provide specialist advice.

Whether you are interested in building a more holistic security risk management program, helping your cyber and physical security teams work together more effectively or just understanding more about the vital dependencies between the two, we'd love to help.
