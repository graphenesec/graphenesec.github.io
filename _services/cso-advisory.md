From setting up a newly-appointed CISO with what they need to get started, to advising a senior executive on the finer points or cyber security, we are happy to assist.

One of the foundations of effective cyber security is making it a continuous, ongoing process. A key part of that is having a member of the organisation who is responsible for maintaining cyber security. A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Security Officer (CSO) or equivalent, is therefore a critical component of any organisation's cyber security.

While some smaller organisations choose to outsource the CISO/CSO role, we would prefer to help equip a member of the organisation with what they need to provide more consistent and ongoing security management. By imparting a fit-for-purpose level of foundational cyber security knowledge, we can set new security leaders up for success.

At the other end of the scale, we know that even highly skilled and experienced CISOs and CSOs can benefit from advisory in specific areas. A prime example of this, for which we are highly capable, includes physical security advisory for CISOs transitioning to a CSO role.
